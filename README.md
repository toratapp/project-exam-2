Noroff school assignment, Front-end development. Project exam 2. The assignment was to create a new front end for an existing social media company.

## Description

Giggles is a social media platform for parents and guardians who want to help each other become the best parents they can be and share tips and insight about different parenting styles. Target audience: moms, dads and guardians of small children, ages 25-45 main group. Secondary groups: young parents ages 16-24 and old parents ages 46-52.

Like most other social media platforms, the user can create a profile, login, update their profile, view posts, comment on posts, react to posts, view comments and reactions on the posts, create their own posts, update and delete their own posts, find other profiles and follow and unfollow those profiles.

In this assignment I used React with Vite, Zustand for state management and Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for appearance with customization to create a more unique design which separates this social media platform from the competitors.
